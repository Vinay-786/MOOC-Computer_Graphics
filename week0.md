***Read the following and answer the question follows:***  
 <p>System modeling is the process of developing abstract models of a system, with each model presenting a different view or perspective of that system. It is about representing a system using some kind of graphical notation, which is now almost always based on notations in the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Models help the analyst to understand the functionality of the system; they are used to communicate with customers.</P>

Models can explain the system from different perspectives:

- An external perspective, where you model the context or environment of the system.

- An interaction perspective, where you model the interactions between a system and its environment, or between the components of a system.

- A structural perspective, where you model the organization of a system or the structure of the data that is processed by the system.

- A behavioral perspective, where you model the dynamic behavior of the system and how it responds to events
